                focuses on health, that takes account of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit),

            <h4>4.What is the line of treatment / line of management ?</h4>
            <p>Diagnosis at the time of consultation is the centrepiece for deciding the line of
                treatment. Primarily, patients are guided thoroughly about life style changes
                and medication is prescribed only if considered necessary.
                Adjuvants of treatments also include physical therapy, yoga, balanced diet, acupressure / acupuncture
                and other alternative therapies.</p>

            <h4>6.Why wellness Homeo Clinics International ?</h4>
            <p>At our clinics we treat our patients through a holistic approach in an integrated way.
                We believe in keeping it simple & rely on our analytic skills to identify the cause of ailment & then
                plan the treatment. The time tested & reliable method of preparing a detailed history & conducting basic
                physical examination is followed assiduously & has a distinct advantage over the current practice of
                suggesting a battery of tests to find the source of the problem. We resort to investigations only to
                conform a positive possible diagnosis or to rule out any lethal conditions where a physical examination
                is
                contradictory or doesn't reveal the true nature of the problem. In today's scenario it is easy to
                confuse
                medicare & healthcare and often it is found that both are projected as the same. At our clinics we take
                the
                effort to distinguish between the two to make sure that
                patients are not confused by varying methodologies and complicated jargon</p>
